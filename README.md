# advent-of-code-2024
Back to Rust, this time I will be nice to the borrow checker.

To format:
```bash
cd runner
cargo fmt
cd ../days
cargo fmt
cd ../helpers
cargo fmt
cd ..
```

To run:
```bash
cd runner
cargo run --release
cd ..
```

## To-do

- Automate input fetch and submitting (with cache).
- Extract libraries.
